INTRODUCTION                                    *open-alternate*

The Vim open-alternate plugin is a plugin designed to help you quickly switch
to editing the alternate file to the one that is currently open. The following
file types are currently supported.

                     RSpec -> Ruby file (Ruby on Rails logic included)
                      Ruby -> RSpec File (Ruby on Rails logic included)
          Cucumber Feature -> Cucumber Step Definition file
  Cucumber Step Definition -> Cucumber Feature file

This is especially useful when you are in a TDD/BDD red-green-refactor cycle
and you need to quickly alternate between the RSpec file and the Ruby
implementation file. Or, if you are at the Cucumber level and you need to
alternate between the Cucumber Feature file and the Cucumber Step Definition
file. When the |open-alternate-commands| is used it quickly opens up the
alternate file to the currently opened file in a new buffer ready for editing.

COMMANDS                                        *open-alternate-commands*

                                                *open-alternaate-:OpenAlternate*
:OpenAlternate           Open the alternate file to the currently opened file.

MAPPINGS                                        *open-alternate-mappings*

This plugin does not automatically define any mappings. However, we do
recommend the following mapping.

nnoremap <leader>. :OpenAlternate<cr>

The above mapping would make it so that <leader>. when pressed would execute
the :OpenAlternate command.
