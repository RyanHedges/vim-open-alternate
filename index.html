<h2>What it provides?</h2>

<p>This plugin provides a simple solution for opening alternate files
intelligently in <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>. It does this by providing a
user-command called <code>OpenAlternate</code> which when executed will open the
alternate file to the currently opened file.</p>

<h3>Supported File Types</h3>

<p>Currently, this plugin supports the following list of file types.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>
      Current File
    </th>
    <th>
      Alternate File
    </th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>
      RSpec File
    </td>
    <td>
      Ruby Implementation file (includes logic for Ruby on Rails)
    </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>
      Ruby Implementation File
    </td>
    <td>
      RSpec file (includes logic for Ruby on Rails)
    </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>
      Cucumber Feature File
    </td>
    <td>

</table><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen.vim</a> and using it in
combination with <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">git
submodules</a> as describe in
this <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/">Vimcast - Synchronizing plugins with git submodules and
pathogen</a>.</p>

<p>If your installation method is the above recommended one, it should be as
simple as running the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.vim/
git submodule add git@github.com:cyphactor/vim-open-alternate.git bundle/vim-open-alternate
git add .
git commit -m "Added vim-open-alternate plugin to my setup."
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using another method, you are on your own. I have been told that
this plugin is compatible with <a href="http://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a>
but I have not tested it myself.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The recommended configuration for this plugin is to simply map a key combo to
run the <code>OpenAlternate</code> command for you. This can easily be done by adding the
following to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;. :OpenAlternate&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example I map my normal mode <code>&lt;leader&gt;.</code> key combo to execute the
<code>OpenAlternate</code> command, in turn opening the alternate file for editing.</p>

<p>You can of course map this command anyway you like, or even choose not to map
it and just execute the command as follows when you need it.</p>

<pre><code>:OpenAlternate&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>I took the idea for my <code>&lt;leader&gt;.</code> binding and some logic for opening the
alternate file from Gary Bernhardt's vim setup. I also took bits and pieces of
file path conversions for alternate files from numerios friends <code>.vimrc</code>
files. Therefore, credit must go out to Gary Bernhardt for a reasonable
starting point as well as my numerous friends for sharing their alternate
file path conversions with me.</p>
